Five Guys Burger visit:

There were total 8 workers behind the counter. Two workers were on Front Counters and 6 workers were in Kitchen area. Out of those 6 workers in Kitchen, 5 were Kitchen workers and 1 was Manager who was also working in the Kitchen with other Kitchen workers.

On my visit to Five Guys Burger, I ordered a custom burger. My order included Little Bacon Burger with Mayo, Lettuce, Grilled Onions, Grilled Mushrooms and Bar-B-Q Sauce.

1. I placed an order with Front Counter worker. He put my order in POS system and asked for a payment. Then, I made a payment. Upon receipt of a payment, he notifies Kitchen workers about new order. At the same time, he prints out the receipt. If customer has ordered milkshake, he would prepare milkshake and deliver it to customer.

2. Upon received notification from Front Counter worker, Kitchen Worker 1 printed the receipt and started preparing for bun. At the same time, manager put patty and vegetables to be grilled on grill. Simultaneously, Kitchen Worker 4 checked whether the order contains fries or not. If the order would include fries, then Kitchen Worker 4 would prepare fries.

3. Once bun and grilled items were ready, Kitchen Worker 2 put them on the bottom side of bun and then put cheese on top of it.

4. After that, Kitchen Worker 3 put all the toppings I ordered put on top side of the bun and close the burger.

5. Once the burger was ready, Kitchen Worker 5 wrapped my burger and put it into paper bag and delivered me my order.
