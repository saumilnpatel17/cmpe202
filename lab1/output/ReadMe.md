Lab 1 Question 2:

There are four existing states which were already given as the source. To complete my solution, I have added one more state "WaitingForCoinState". This state is to put Gumball Machine in waiting state. When user inserts coin but there are not sufficient coins to release a gumball, Gumball Machine will be put into "WaitingForCoin" State.
