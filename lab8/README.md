Lab #8 - Input Mask Design Patterns

In this lab, I have implemented decorator design pattern. I have created CreditCardDecorator abstract class which implements IDisplayComponent and IKeyEventHandler. From this class, I created two decorator classes: SpaceDecorator and ForwardSlashDecorator. SpaceDecorator class will wrap the object of CreditCardNum class and ForwardSlashDecorator will wrap the object of CreditCardExp. Instances of these two decorators will be added to the Screen components along with CreditCardCVC instance. When screen's display method will call SpaceDecorator's display method, it will call CreditCardNum's display method. Whatever result it will receive, it will then add appropriate spaces to that number and will return to Screen. Similarly, when ForwardSlashDecorator's display method gets called, it will call CreditCardExp's display method. Whatever result it will receive, it will add "/" between months and year and then will return that value to Screen.
